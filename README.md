AEtoCss
=======

Processing sketch that takes AE keyframes(or any as long as it they are formatted correctly in a txt file) and outputs CSS keyframe animations

You can follow the tutorial on my site to learn how to format the keyframes and export them from After Effects.

Right now it only exports them with the -webkit- prefix, however it is a simple addition to the script to get it for everything else, which I will add soon.
